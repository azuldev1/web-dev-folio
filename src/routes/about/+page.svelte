				I’m a web developer with a passion for lifelong learning, both in and out of my career. When
				I’m not crafting intuitive web experiences, you’ll find me exploring new places, embracing
				the adventure of travel, and discovering different cultures through food and experiences. I
				also enjoy staying active with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and mountain biking, as well as
				experimenting with cooking cuisines from around the world. These pursuits, along with taking
				care of my family, inspire creativity, adaptability, and a constant drive to grow—qualities
				that enhance both my personal and professional life.
