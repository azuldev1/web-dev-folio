				I'm a web developer with a passion for lifelong learning. When I'm not building intuitive
				web experiences, I enjoy staying active with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, mountain biking, and
				experimenting with cooking cuisines from around the world. These pursuits push me to embrace
				challenges, think creatively, and continuously improveâ€”qualities that fuel both my personal
				growth and professional development.
