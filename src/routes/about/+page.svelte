	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		I’m a web developer with a passion for lifelong learning, both in and out of my career. When I’m
		not crafting intuitive web experiences, you’ll find me exploring new places, embracing the
		adventure of travel, and discovering different cultures through food and experiences. I also
		enjoy staying active with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and mountain biking, as well as experimenting with
		cooking cuisines from around the world. These pursuits, along with taking care of my family,
		inspire creativity, adaptability, and a constant drive to grow—qualities that enhance both my
		personal and professional life.
